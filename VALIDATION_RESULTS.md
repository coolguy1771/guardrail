# RBAC Validation Results Summary

## Overview

The guardrail RBAC validator successfully detected 23 security issues across the test data, demonstrating the effectiveness of our NIST SP 800-190 based validation rules.

## Findings Breakdown

### By Severity
- ðŸ”´ **HIGH**: 15 issues (65%)
- ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM**: 5 issues (22%)
- ðŸ”µ **LOW**: 3 issues (13%)

### By Rule Type

#### High Severity Issues (RBAC001-RBAC014)
1. **RBAC001 - Avoid Wildcard Permissions**: Detected multiple instances of dangerous wildcard usage in verbs, resources, and API groups
2. **RBAC002 - Avoid Cluster-Admin Binding**: Found several bindings to the cluster-admin role
3. **RBAC006 - Restrict Exec and Attach Permissions**: Identified roles with pod exec/attach permissions
4. **RBAC007 - Limit Impersonation Privileges**: Found roles allowing user/group/serviceaccount impersonation
5. **RBAC008 - Restrict Escalate and Bind Verbs**: Detected privilege escalation risks through escalate/bind permissions
6. **RBAC009 - Audit Privileged Container Access**: Found access to PodSecurityPolicies and SecurityContextConstraints
7. **RBAC011 - Limit Webhook Configuration Access**: Identified permissions to modify webhook configurations
8. **RBAC012 - Restrict CRD and APIService Modifications**: Found permissions to modify CRDs and API services
9. **RBAC014 - Restrict TokenRequest and CertificateSigningRequest**: Detected token and certificate creation permissions

#### Medium Severity Issues
1. **RBAC003 - Avoid Secrets Access**: Multiple roles with direct read access to secrets
2. **RBAC005 - Avoid Service Account Token Automounting**: Service accounts bound to risky roles
3. **RBAC010 - Restrict Node and PersistentVolume Access**: Direct write access to nodes and PVs
4. **RBAC013 - Separate Concerns with Namespace Isolation**: RoleBindings referencing ClusterRoles

#### Low Severity Issues
1. **RBAC004 - Prefer Namespaced Roles**: ClusterRoles containing only namespace-scoped resources

## Key Security Concerns Identified

### Critical Security Risks
1. **Cluster-admin bindings**: Multiple bindings granting full cluster access
2. **Wildcard permissions**: Unrestricted access through * in verbs, resources, and API groups
3. **Container escape vectors**: Pod exec/attach permissions that could lead to container escape
4. **Privilege escalation paths**: Roles with escalate/bind permissions on RBAC resources

### Common Patterns
1. Over-privileged service accounts with admin-level access
2. Namespace-admin roles with cluster-wide permissions
3. Debug/development roles with production-level access
4. Missing principle of least privilege implementation

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Remove all cluster-admin bindings except for essential cluster operators
   - Replace wildcard permissions with specific, scoped permissions
   - Restrict exec/attach permissions to break-glass emergency accounts only
   - Implement strict controls on impersonation privileges

2. **Security Improvements**:
   - Use namespace-specific Roles instead of ClusterRoles where possible
   - Implement ResourceNames restrictions for sensitive resources like secrets
   - Disable automountServiceAccountToken for non-essential service accounts
   - Regular RBAC audits using this tool

3. **Best Practices**:
   - Follow principle of least privilege
   - Use separate roles for read and write operations
   - Implement time-bound access for elevated permissions
   - Regular review and rotation of service account credentials

## Test Coverage

The validation successfully tested all 10 NIST-based rules (RBAC005-RBAC014) plus the 4 original rules (RBAC001-RBAC004), demonstrating comprehensive coverage of common RBAC security issues in Kubernetes environments.
